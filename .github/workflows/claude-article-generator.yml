            Analyze this issue to determine if it has enough content to write a React community article in German.

            Use `gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}` to read the full issue content.

            Check for:
            1. Clear topic related to React, React ecosystem, or React development practices
            2. Sufficient context or external links with relevant content
            3. Topic relevance for the German React community
            4. Estimated content depth (should allow 5-10 minute read)

            Look at existing articles in _posts/ to understand the quality bar and topic style.

            Post your analysis as a comment to the issue using:
            `gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --body "your analysis"`

            Your analysis should include:
            - ✅ or ❌ for each criterion
            - Suggested article title in German
            - Key points to cover
            - Estimated reading time
            - Final recommendation: APPROVED or REJECTED

            End your comment with exactly "RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED" or "RECOMMENDATION: REJECTED" on the last line.

            Generate a high-quality German article for the React community based on the issue content.

            Steps:
            1. Read the issue content: `gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}`
            2. Review CLAUDE.md for article structure and format requirements
            3. Look at 2-3 recent articles in _posts/ directories to match the writing style
            4. Create a comprehensive article (5-10 minute read, ~1500-2500 words)

            IMPORTANT: You only need to create the markdown file. Don't try to build or test the Jekyll site.

            Article requirements:
            - Language: German
            - Target audience: German React developers (all levels)
            - Writing style: Informative, friendly, practical
            - Include code examples where relevant (use JSX/TypeScript)
            - Use proper markdown formatting with headers, lists, code blocks
            - Front matter must include: title, description, author (use "Robin Böhm"), published_at (today's date), categories, header_image (use "header.jpg")

            File structure:
            - Create directory: _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/
            - Create file: _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
            - Use current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
            - Create a URL-friendly slug from the title (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars)

            Header Image (WICHTIG):
            1. Search for a relevant image on Unsplash using their API
            2. Use the UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY environment variable for authentication
            3. Unsplash API endpoint: https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM&per_page=1&orientation=landscape
               - Add header: "Authorization: Client-ID $UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY"
               - Choose search terms based on article topic (in English, e.g., "react javascript code", "web development", "programming")
            4. Download the image from the "urls.regular" field in the API response
            5. Save as: _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/header.jpg
            6. Reference it in front matter as: header_image: "header.jpg"

            Example curl command:
            ```bash
            # Search for image
            SEARCH_TERM="react javascript"
            IMAGE_URL=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Client-ID $UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY" \
              "https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=${SEARCH_TERM}&per_page=1&orientation=landscape" | \
              jq -r '.results[0].urls.regular')

            # Download image
            curl -o _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/header.jpg "$IMAGE_URL"
            ```

            Article structure:
            - Start with an engaging introduction explaining the topic's relevance
            - Use clear section headers (##, ###)
            - Include practical examples and code snippets
            - Explain concepts thoroughly but concisely
            - End with a conclusion or call-to-action
            - Consider linking to relevant resources or documentation

            After creating the markdown file and downloading the header image in _posts/:
            1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b article/issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}`
            2. Add and commit both the markdown file and header image: `git add _posts/ && git commit -m "Add article with header image from issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"`
            3. Push branch: `git push origin article/issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}`
            4. Create PR with gh CLI:
               ```
               gh pr create \
                 --title "New Article: [Article Title]" \
                 --body "This article was generated based on issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.
